# Overview
FuelLib (SWR-25-26) utilizes the tables and functions of the Group Contribution Method (GCM) as proposed by [Constantinou and Gani (1994)](https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.690401011) and [Constantinou, Gani and O'Connel (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-3812(94)02593-P), with additional physical properties discussed in [Govindaraju & Ihme (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.06.079).  The code is based on Pavan B. Govindaraju's [Matlab implementation](https://github.com/gpavanb-old/GroupContribution) of the GCM, and has been expanded to include additional thermodynamic properties and mixture properties.  The fuel library contains gas chromatography (GC x GC) data for a variety of fuels ranging from simple single component fuels to complex jet fuels.  The GC x GC data for POSF jet fuels comes from [Edwards (2020)](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1093317.pdf).

## Python Environment
The following conda environment is required to run this code:
~~~
conda create --name fuellib-env matplotlib pandas scipy black 
~~~

## Running the Code
This repository includes multiple tutorials of ways to use FuelLib.  We recommend starting with the basic tutorial, `tutorials/basic.py`, which is documented at [https://NatLabRockies.github.io/FuelLib/tutorials.html#introduction]. The script `tutorials/mixtureProperties.py` calculates a given mixture's density, viscosity and vapor pressure from GC x GC data.  The results are plotted against data from NIST and [Edwards (2020)](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1093317.pdf). 

# Contributing
New contributions are always welcome.  If you have an idea for a new feature follow these steps:
1. Fork the main repository
2. Create a `newFeature` branch that contains your changes
3. Update the sphinx documentation in `newFeature`
4. Format the source code files using the [Black code formatter](https://github.com/psf/black) by running the following command:
   ~~~
   find . -name "*.py" -print0 | xargs -0 black
   ~~~
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) from `newFeature` on your fork to branch `main` FuelLib repository.

## Running Tests

The repository uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to run its test suite.
From the repository root:

~~~
pip install pytest
pytest -q                               # run everything
pytest -q -m 'not slow and not d86'      # fast unit/regression checks only
pytest tests/test_integration_d86.py -q  # D86 integration tests only
~~~

### Available tests

* **`tests/test_accuracy.py`** — single-component accuracy regression (heptane,
  decane, dodecane) against NIST data.
* **`tests/test_integration_d86.py`** — full-distillation D86 integration test
  that runs the RK2 simulation for `posf10264`, `posf10325`, and `posf10289`,
  interpolates onto the NJFCP experimental volume-percentage grid
  (`0.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99.5`), and compares against:
  1. the committed baseline in `tests/baselinePredictions/d86/{fuel}.csv`
     (tight tolerance — catches model regressions), and
  2. the NJFCP experimental data in
     `fuelData/experimentalData/d86_NJFCP.csv` (loose tolerance — catches
     catastrophic breakage).

### Regenerating baselines

When an intentional model change makes the committed D86 baseline obsolete,
regenerate it via either of:

~~~
python scripts/regenerate_d86_baselines.py
# or, equivalently:
pytest tests/test_integration_d86.py --update-baselines
~~~

## Sphinx Documentation
This repository uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) to generate documentation.  This requires the following Conda environment:
~~~
conda create --name sphinx-env sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme sphinxcontrib-bibtex pandas scipy
~~~

To view the documentation locally, build the html using the following: 
~~~
cd FuelLib/docs/
sphinx-build -M html . _build/
~~~
You should now be able to view the html by opening `FuelLib/docs/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser.
